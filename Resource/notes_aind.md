Need more effort thinking:

- Extra Tips

- Here are some questions to consider:
- Why does DFS not provide an optimal plan for this case?
- Which are the fastest and slowest uninformed algorithms? Why?
- Which are the fastest and slowest heuristic searches? Why?
- Which algorithms (uninformed and heuristic) have the lowest node expansions and goal tests? Why? 
- What does this mean for the performance in this problem?
- Please don't forget to site your references like you did in your research report
